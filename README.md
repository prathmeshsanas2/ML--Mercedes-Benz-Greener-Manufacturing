# ML--Mercedes-Benz-Greener-Manufacturing
Reduce the time a Mercedes-Benz spends on the test bench.

You are required to reduce the time that cars spend on the test bench. Others will work with a dataset representing different permutations of features in a Mercedes-Benz car to predict the time it takes to pass testing. Optimal algorithms will contribute to faster testing, resulting in lower carbon dioxide emissions without reducing Mercedes-Benzâ€™s standards.
Following actions should be performed:

If for any column(s), the variance is equal to zero, then you need to remove those variable(s).
Check for null and unique values for test and train sets.
Apply label encoder.
Perform dimensionality reduction.
Predict your test_df values using XGBoost.
